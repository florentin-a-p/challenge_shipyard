# challenge_shipyard

A simple demo of how to implement OOP concepts into real-world case of a shipping yard company. The main concepts that are implemented are encapsulation and polymorphism. When you run the app, you will act as a customer who wants to order a custom ship from the shipping yard company. You will be able to customize the type of the ship (motorboat, sailing ship, cruise), specify the dimensions, and check the status of the ship and the corresponding location (procurement, assembly, paint, test, delivered).
